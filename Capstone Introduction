Providence, RI is a smaller city in the densely packed northeast United States. 
Overshadowed by it's nearby neighbors Boston and New York is the capital of Rhode Island is one of the larger cities in the area. 
Should someone be interested in opening a restaurant in Providence it is worth considering what cuisines are popular in the area and how the distribution 
of restaurants in Providence compares. 
By looking at the dining options of the largest cities in the northeast I hope to generate a profile of popular food in the region surrounding Providence.

Given this profile and knowledge of the dining options in Providence I will look for differences. 
This is to find opportunities for new restaurants in Providence that would be popular in the region but are relatively underrepresented in Providence.
